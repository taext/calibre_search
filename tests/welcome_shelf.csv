"Holiday, Ryan","Ryan Holiday","You've seen it all before. A malicious online rumor costs a company millions. A political sideshow derails the national news cycle and destroys a candidate. Some product or celebrity zooms from total obscurity to viral sensation. What you don't know is that someone is responsible for all this. Usually, someone like me. 

I'm a media manipulator. In a world where blogs control and distort the news, my job is to control blogs-as much as any one person can. 

In today's culture...   
1) Blogs like Gawker, Buzzfeed and the Huffington Post drive the media agenda.   
2) Bloggers are slaves to money, technology, and deadlines.   
3) Manipulators wield these levers to shape everything you read, see and watch-online and off. 

Why am I giving away these secrets? Because I'm tired of a world where blogs take indirect bribes, marketers help write the news, reckless journalists spread lies, and no one is accountable for any of it. I'm pulling back the curtain because I don't want anyone else to get blindsided. 

I'm going to explain exactly how the media really works. What you choose to do with this information is up to you.

"Holiday, Ryan","Ryan Holiday","**“The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.”  — Marcus Aurelius**

We are stuck, stymied, frustrated. But it needn’t be this way. There is a formula for success that’s been followed by the icons of history—from John D. Rockefeller to Amelia Earhart to Ulysses S. Grant to Steve Jobs—a formula that let them turn obstacles into opportunities. Faced with impossible situations, they found the astounding triumphs we all seek. 

These men and women were not exceptionally brilliant, lucky, or gifted. Their success came from timeless philosophical principles laid down by a Roman emperor who struggled to articulate a method for excellence in any and all situations. 

This book reveals that formula for the first time—and shows us how we can turn our own adversity into advantage.

"Sachs, Jonah","Jonah Sachs","**Trying to get your message heard? Build an iconic brand?  
Welcome to the battlefield.**

The story wars are all around us. They are the struggle to be heard in a world of media noise and clamor. Today, most brand messages and mass appeals for causes are drowned out before they even reach us. But a few consistently break through the din, using the only tool that has ever moved minds and changed behavior—great stories. 

With insights from mythology, advertising history, evolutionary biology, and psychology, viral storyteller and advertising expert Jonah Sachs takes readers into a fascinating world of seemingly insurmountable challenges and enormous opportunity. You’ll discover how: 

• Social media tools are driving a return to the oral tradition, in which stories that matter rise above the fray  
• Marketers have become today’s mythmakers, providing society with explanation, meaning, and ritual  
• Memorable stories based on timeless themes build legions of eager evangelists  
• Marketers and audiences can work together to create deeper meaning and stronger partnerships in building a better world  
• Brands like Old Spice, *The Story of Stuff*, Nike, the Tea Party, and Occupy Wall Street created and sustained massive viral buzz 

*Winning the Story Wars* is a call to arms for business communicators to cast aside broken traditions and join a revolution to build the iconic brands of the future. It puts marketers in the role of heroes with a chance to transform not just their craft but the enterprises they represent. After all, success in the story wars doesn’t come just from telling great stories, but from learning to live them.

"Waitzkin, Josh","Josh Waitzkin","Josh Waitzkin knows what it means to be at the top of his game. A public figure since winning his first National Chess Championship at the age of nine, Waitzkin was catapulted into a media whirlwind as a teenager when his father's book *Searching for Bobby Fischer* was made into a major motion picture. After dominating the scholastic chess world for ten years, Waitzkin expanded his horizons, taking on the martial art Tai Chi Chuan and ultimately earning the title of World Champion. How was he able to reach the pinnacle of two disciplines that on the surface seem so different? ""I've come to realize that what I am best at is not Tai Chi, and it is not chess,"" he says. ""What I am best at is the art of learning."" 

In his riveting new book, *The Art of Learning*, Waitzkin tells his remarkable story of personal achievement and shares the principles of learning and performance that have propelled him to the top -- twice. 

With a narrative that combines heart-stopping martial arts wars and tense chess face-offs with life lessons that speak to all of us, *The Art of Learning* takes readers through Waitzkin's unique journey to excellence. He explains in clear detail how a well-thought-out, principled approach to learning is what separates success from failure. Waitzkin believes that achievement, even at the championship level, is a function of a lifestyle that fuels a creative, resilient growth process. Rather than focusing on climactic wins, Waitzkin reveals the inner workings of his everyday method, from systematically triggering intuitive breakthroughs, to honing techniques into states of remarkable potency, to mastering the art of performance psychology. 

Through his own example, Waitzkin explains how to embrace defeat and make mistakes work for you. Does your opponent make you angry? Waitzkin describes how to channel emotions into creative fuel. As he explains it, obstacles are not obstacles but challenges to overcome, to spur the growth process by turning weaknesses into strengths. He illustrates the exact routines that he has used in all of his competitions, whether mental or physical, so that you too can achieve your peak performance zone in any competitive or professional circumstance. 

In stories ranging from his early years taking on chess hustlers as a seven year old in New York City's Washington Square Park, to dealing with the pressures of having a film made about his life, to International Chess Championships in India, Hungary, and Brazil, to gripping battles against powerhouse fighters in Taiwan in the Push Hands World Championships, *The Art of Learning* encapsulates an extraordinary competitor's life lessons in a page-turning narrative.

"Richards, Heuer J & Pherson, Randolph H","Heuer J Richards & Randolph H Pherson","This book takes the relatively new concept of structured analytic techniques, defines its place in a taxonomy of analytic methods, and moves it a giant leap forward. It describes 50 techniques that are divided into eight categories. There are techniques for:

  * Decomposition and Visualization 

  * Idea Generation 

  * Scenarios and Indicators 

  * Hypothesis Generation and Testing 

  * Cause and Effect 

  * Challenge Analysis 

  * Conflict Management 

  * Decision Support 

Each structured technique involves a step-by-step process that externalizes an individual analyst s thinking in a manner that makes it readily apparent to others, thereby enabling it to be shared, built on, and easily critiqued by others. This structured and transparent process combined with the intuitive input of subject matter experts is expected to reduce the risk of analytic error.

Our current high tech, global environment increasingly requires collaboration between analysts with different areas of expertise and analysts representing different organizational perspectives. Structured analytic techniques are the ideal process for guiding the interaction of analysts within a small team or group. Each step in a technique prompts relevant discussion within the team, and such discussion generates and evaluates substantially more divergent information and more new ideas than a team that does not use a structured process.

By defining the domain of structured analytic techniques, providing a manual for using and teaching these techniques, and outlining procedures for evaluating and validating these techniques, this book lays a common ground for continuing improvement of how analysis is done. These techniques are especially needed in the field of intelligence analysis where analysts typically deal with incomplete, ambiguous and sometimes deceptive information. However, these practical tools for analysis are also useful in a wide variety of professions including law enforcement, medicine, finance, and business.

"Eyal, Nir","Nir Eyal","**How do successful companies create products people can’t put down?**

Why do some products capture widespread attention while others flop? What makes us engage with certain products out of sheer habit? Is there a pattern underlying how technologies hook us?

Nir Eyal answers these questions (and many more) by explaining the Hook Model—a four-step process embedded into the products of many successful companies to subtly encourage customer behavior. Through consecutive “hook cycles,” these products reach their ultimate goal of bringing users back again and again without depending on costly advertising or aggressive messaging.

*Hooked* is based on Eyal’s years of research, consulting, and practical experience. He wrote the book he wished had been available to him as a start-up founder—not abstract theory, but a how-to guide for building better products. *Hooked* is written for product managers, designers, marketers, start-up founders, and anyone who seeks to understand how products influence our behavior.

Eyal provides readers with:

• Practical insights to create user habits that stick.  
• Actionable steps for building products people love.

• Fascinating examples from the iPhone to Twitter, Pinterest to the Bible App, and many other habit-forming products.

"Lanier, Jaron","Jaron Lanier","Who Owns The Future? is the new masterwork from the prophet of the digital age, Jaron Lanier, author of You Are Not A Gadget.In the past, a revolution in production, such as the industrial revolution, generally increased the wealth and freedom of people. The digital revolution we are living through is different. Instead of leaving a greater number of us in excellent financial health, the effect of digital technologies - and the companies behind them - is to concentrate wealth, reduce growth, and challenge the livelihoods of an ever-increasing number of people. As the protections of the middle class disappear, washed away by crises in capitalism, what is being left in their place? And what else could replace them?Why is this happening, and what might we do about it? In Who Owns the Future? Jaron Lanier shows how the new power paradigm operates, how it is conceived and controlled, and why it is leading to a collapse in living standards. Arguing that the 'information economy' ruins markets, he reminds us that markets should reward more people, not fewer. He shows us why the digital revolution means more corporations making money and avoiding risk by hiding value off their books, which means more financial risk for the rest of us. From the inner workings of the 'sirenic servers' at the heart of the new power system, to an exploration of the meaning of mass unemployment events, the misuse of big data, and the deep and increasing erasure of human endeavour, Lanier explores the effects of this situation on democracy and individuals, and proposes a more human, humane reality, where risk and reward is shared equally, and the digital revolution creates opportunity for all.Praise for You Are Not a Gadget:'Fabulous - I couldn't put it down and shouted out Yes! Yes! on many pages ... a landmark book that will have people talking and arguing for years into the future' Lee Smolin'A provocative and sure-to-be-controversial book . . . Lucid, powerful and persuasive' The New York Times'Short and frightening ... from a position of real knowledge and insight' Zadie SmithJaron Lanier is a philosopher and computer scientist who has spent his career pushing the transformative power of modern technology to its limits. From coining the term 'Virtual Reality' to developing cutting-edge medical imaging and surgical techniques, Lanier is one of the premier designers and engineers at work today, and is linked with UC Berkeley and Microsoft. A musician with a collection of over 700 instruments, he has been recognised by Encyclopedia Britannica (but certainly not Wikipedia) as one of history's 300 or so greatest inventors and named one of the top one hundred public intellectuals in the world by Prospect and Foreign Policy. His first book, You Are Not A Gadget, was hailed as a 'poetic and prophetic' defence of the human in an age of machines.

"Allen, David","David Allen","### 

In today's world, yesterday's methods just don't work. Veteran coach and management consultant **David Allen** recognizes that time management is useless the minute your schedule is interrupted; setting priorities isn't relevant when your e-mail is down; procrastination solutions won't help if your goals aren't clear. Instead, Allen shares with readers the proven methods he has already introduced in seminars and at top organizations across the country. The key to Getting Things Done? Relaxation.

Allen's premise is simple: our ability to be productive is directly proportional to our ability to relax. Only when our minds are clear and our thoughts are organized can we achieve stress-free productivity. His seamless system teaches us how to identify, track, and-most important-choose the next action on all our tasks, commitments, and projects and thus master all the demands on our time while unleashing our creative potential. The book's stylish, dynamic design makes it easy to follow Allen's tips, examples, and inspiration to achieve what we all seek-energy, focus, and relaxed control.

With this hands-on guide, you’ll learn how to write effective, idiomatic Python code by leveraging its best—and possibly most neglected—features. Author Luciano Ramalho takes you through Python’s core language features and libraries, and shows you how to make your code shorter, faster, and more readable at the same time.

Many experienced programmers try to bend Python to fit patterns they learned from other languages, and never discover Python features outside of their experience. With this book, those Python programmers will thoroughly learn how to become proficient in Python 3.

This book covers:

  * **Python data model:** understand how special methods are the key to the consistent behavior of objects
  * **Data structures:** take full advantage of built-in types, and understand the text vs bytes duality in the Unicode age
  * **Functions as objects:** view Python functions as first-class objects, and understand how this affects popular design patterns
  * **Object-oriented idioms:** build classes by learning about references, mutability, interfaces, operator overloading, and multiple inheritance
  * **Control flow:** leverage context managers, generators, coroutines, and concurrency with the concurrent.futures and asyncio packages
  * **Metaprogramming:** understand how properties, attribute descriptors, class decorators, and metaclasses work

"Larabee, Ann","Ann Larabee","""[A] valuable account ... *The Wrong Hands* brilliantly guides us through [the] challenges to American democracy."" -Howard P. Segal, *Times Higher Education * 

Gun ownership rights are treated as sacred in America, but what happens when dissenters moved beyond firearm possession into the realm of high explosives? How should the state react? Ann Larabee's *The Wrong Hands*, a remarkable history of do-it-yourself weapons manuals from the late nineteenth century to the recent Boston Marathon bombing, traces how efforts to ferret out radicals willing to employ ever-more violent methods fueled the growth of the American security state. But over time, the government's increasingly forceful targeting of violent books and ideas-not the weapons themselves-threatened to undermine another core American right: free expression. 

In the 1886 Haymarket Square bombing, a new form of revolutionary violence that had already made its mark in Europe arrived in the United States. At the subsequent trial, the judge allowed into evidence Johann Most's infamous *The Science of Revolutionary Warfare*, which allegedly served as a cookbook for the accused. Most's work was the first of a long line of explosive manuals relied on by radicals. By the 1960s, small publishers were drawing from publicly available US military sources to produce works that catered to a growing popular interest in DIY weapons making. The most famous was *The Anarchist Cookbook *(1971), which soon achieved legendary status-and a lasting presence in the courts. Even novels, such as William Pierce's *The Turner Diaries*, have served as evidence in prosecutions of right-wing radicals. More recently, websites explaining how to make all manner of weapons, including suicide vests, have proliferated. 

The state's right to police such information has always hinged on whether the disseminators have legitimate First Amendment rights. Larabee ends with an analysis of the 1979 publication of instructions for making a nuclear weapon, which raises the ultimate question: should a society committed to free speech allow a manual for constructing such a weapon to disseminate freely? Both authoritative and eye-opening, *The Wrong Hands* will reshape our understanding of the history of radical violence and state repression in America.

### Review

""A fascinating work of historical recovery and textual discovery. Ann Larabee asks hard questions about violence, terrorism, and free speech, and demands that we look to history to help sort out the answers.""   
--Beverly Gage, Professor of History, Yale University, and author of *The Day Wall Street Exploded: A Story of America in its First Age of Terror*

""Larabee's brilliant, groundbreaking history explores fascinating and profound questions about freedom and dangerous information. Ranging from the 19th century anarchists to al-Qaeda and the Boston marathon bombers, *The Wrong Hands* is invaluable for understanding both the terrorist threat and the threat to civil liberties posed by overreacting to terrorism.""   
--Richard Bach Jensen, author of *The Battle against Anarchist Terrorism: An International History, 1878-1934*

""One of our best writers, Ann Larabee, brings extensive research and splendid prose to bear on a topic that is vital to democracy-how to regulate, if at all, speech that contains instructions for weapons and violence. With essential detail and sharp analysis, Larabee discusses the history of weapons manuals, the political use of technical information, the wide variety of governmental responses, the constitutional and moral issues at stake, and the challenges of the digital age. She makes a strong argument that in the contest between suppression and tolerance the legitimacy of government itself can become problematic.""   
--Steven S. Smith, Kate M. Gregg Distinguished Professor of Social Science and Professor of Political Science, Washington University

""To date, *The Wrong Hands* is not only the most comprehensive book on the history of bomb making in the U.S. as tied to instructional manuals, but it also digs into corners and places the average person could not go, providing a thoughtful narrative about balancing the nation's constitutional rights and protections."" --*Lansing City Pulse*

""Today, the internet and social media provide unprecedented opportunities for non-violent critics, actual terrorists and government officials alike to perpetuate their positions indefinitely. *The Wrong Hands* brilliantly guides us through these challenges to American democracy."" --*Times Higher* *Education*

""For well over a century the United States government has regarded the circulation of weapons manuals and instruction booklets as dangerous and criminal. Ann Larabee traces the nuanced history of do-it-yourself weapons manuals from the late nineteenth century to the present to explain their role in the state's evolving policy toward radical dissent. The book covers a wide variety of topics from The Anarchist Cookbook to Edward Abbey's novel The Monkey Wrench Gang, which have been accused of inspiring domestic terrorists. It is an interesting look at the battle between free speech and the right of the public to have access to information that could be dangerous in the wrong hands."" -- *Skeptical Inquirer*

""An entertaining, enlightening book on what happens when restricted information gets into the hands of the 'wrong people.' Highly recommended."" --*Choice*

""The core of *The Wrong Hands* is not so much about the existence of these weapons and explosives manuals or their actual historical use by various American radicals from the 19th century until today, however. It is, instead, much more about the heated arguments over the publication, distribution, or possession of these manuals - a conflict of First Amendment/free expression principles and domestic security and law enforcement concerns....*The Wrong Hands* ough to be of interest to many lawfare readers""   
--Kenneth Anderson, *Lawfare Blog*

""Meticulously researched, often illuminating, always thought-provoking,   
Ann Larabee's *The Wrong Hands* is a nuanced and essential supplement to   
our understanding of the complexities of how dissent, and efforts to repress it,   
has shaped the United States.""   
--*Journal for the Study of Radicalism*

"Hall, Wayne Michael","Wayne Michael Hall","*Intelligence Analysis: How to Think in Complex Environments* fills a void in the existing literature on contemporary warfare by examining the theoretical and conceptual foundations of effective modern intelligence analysis—the type of analysis needed to support military operations in modern, complex operational environments. This volume is an expert guide for rethinking intelligence analysis and understanding the true nature of the operational environment, adversaries, and most importantly, the populace. 

*Intelligence Analysis* proposes substantive improvements in the way the U.S. national security system interprets intelligence, drawing on the groundbreaking work of theorists ranging from Carl von Clauswitz and Sun Tzu to M. Mitchell Waldrop, General David Petraeus, Richards Heuer, Jr., Orson Scott Card, and others. The new ideas presented here will help the nation to amass a formidable, cumulative intelligence power, with distinct advantages over any and all adversaries of the future regardless of the level of war or type of operational environment.

### Review

""This is a brilliant work by the most brilliant intelligence professional the US Army ever produced. Too bad his career terminated at Brigadier General. In this book he continues to contribute to the intellectual improvement of professional thought in a major way. If there has been a failing in the military art in recent years it has been the failure to draw the distinction between what is merely very complicated and that which is complex. In the former the difficulty is establishing, assembling and organizing the facts. And those facts reveal the inner logic of the situation. In the latter the difficulty is establishing what facts belong, and which don't. And how you choose determines the logic of the situation. This book is about how to choose wisely. I recommend it to all who take the profession of arms seriously."" (Huba Wass de Czege, Brigadier General, US Army, Retired, Founder and Former Director of the US Army School of Advanced Military Studies, Former Military Advisor to Secretary General of NATO, Manfred Werner, and Consultant to the US Army for Future Concepts) 

""In *Intelligence Analysis -- How To Think In Complex Environments*, Mike Hall, one of the very best minds in the intelligence community, lays out for those who wish to improve on the quality of their thinking both the theoretical and practical steps to become more effective. A brilliant theoretician Hall also demonstrates excellence in the practical matter of divining what the opposition might do. *Intelligence Analysis -- How To Think In Complex Environments* improves on Richards J. Heurer, Jr's brilliant Psychology of Intelligence Analysis by taking the discussion beyond techniques and checks on critical thinking that enable analyst to be aware at least of bias. Hall and his coauthor suggest the means to get beyond awareness to genuine apperception, which is essential to discovering objectivity and even empathy for those who are our enemies."" (Gregory Fontenot, Colonel US Army (Retired), Directory University of Foreign Military and Cultural Studies, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas) 

""'How to think in a complex environment', what a timely and necessary topic for all of us to contemplate. BG Hall chronicles how globalization and the revolutionary change in information patterns have reshaped the operational environment in which live and work. Complex situations will place a premium on the truly 'artful' leader. Mike provides in this publication a number of suggestions on how one might improve this illusive technique. Instinct, intuition and experience are paramount in pursuit of 'artful' thought and leadership, yet there are numerous ways to improve this skill set. This book delivers. Sun Tzu offers that if the sage ('artful') commander perceives himself and the enemy better than the enemy perceives the same situation, he will win in a thousand battles. Perceiving accurately is the issue and this book provides a valuable assist to the reader in this endeavor."" (Gary Luck, General, US Army (Retired), Former Commander, 2d Infantry Division, Former Commander, JSOC, Former Commander, XVIII Airborne Corps, and Former Commander, USFK and Combined Forces Command, Korea) 

""Analysis, Think and Complex are three powerful words from the title of this superb seminal work that clearly mark its unparalleled significance. General Mike Hall, is an erudite scholar and exemplary leader. Additionally, as a life-long developer of systems and processes that inspire critical thinking skills and insightful reflection, he has created another masterful pattern for successful transformation of caterpillars into butterflies. Grasping, understanding, and practicing his methods and logic will raise the analytical ability of our intelligence community to an all-time high. His skillful writing and engaging process draws us through an experience of teaching and understanding that allows and enables us to exceed even our own highest learning goals. *Intelligence Analysis – How To Think In Complex Environments*, is a remarkable masterwork destined as a classic in the field. ' "" (Frank H. Akers, Jr. PhD, Brigadier General (RET), U.S. Army, Senior Fellow, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and President & CEO, Oak Ridge Strategy Group) 

""Mike Hall has written a brilliant book that reflects the future of intelligence and the focus of the intelligence professionals. As the battlespace evolves in future wars, the methodology of the Intelligence Community must do the same, yet few people 'Get It' the way Mike does. The 'Human Dimension' of warfighting is where the emphasis must be, beginning with prioritization of effort and Mike outlines very articulately how that is accomplished. His views on the fundamental task of analysis are spot on and exactly where we need to go in the future. I will use this book as a text in my 'Introduction To National Intelligence' classes at Hampden Sydney College. A fine piece of work."" (William G Boykin, LTG(R) US ARMY, Former Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence, Wheat Chair of Leadership, Hampden Sydney College)

"Holden, Joshua","Joshua Holden","*The Mathematics of Secrets* takes readers on a fascinating tour of the mathematics behind cryptography—the science of sending secret messages. Most books about cryptography are organized historically, or around how codes and ciphers have been used, such as in government and military intelligence or bank transactions. Joshua Holden instead shows how mathematical principles underpin the ways that different codes and ciphers operate. Holden focuses on both code making and code breaking and he discusses the majority of ancient and modern ciphers currently known. 

Holden begins by looking at substitution ciphers, built by substituting one letter or block of letters for another. Explaining one of the simplest and historically well-known ciphers, the Caesar cipher, Holden establishes the key mathematical idea behind the cipher and discusses how to introduce flexibility and additional notation. Holden goes on to explore polyalphabetic substitution ciphers, transposition ciphers, including one developed by the Spartans, connections between ciphers and computer encryption, stream ciphers, and ciphers involving exponentiation. He also examines public-key ciphers, where the methods used to encrypt messages are public knowledge, and yet, intended recipients are still the only ones who are able to read the message. He concludes with a look at the future of ciphers and where cryptography might be headed. Only basic mathematics up to high school algebra is needed to understand and enjoy the book.

With a plethora of historical anecdotes and real-world examples, *The Mathematics of Secrets *reveals the mathematics working stealthily in the science of coded messages.

""The History of the Kiss by Marcel Danesi serves as part anthropological study and part celebration of this mysterious, sensuous, thrilling activity that holds such power over us all."" - New York Post

""An illuminating look at why kissing is such a powerful act."" - The Guardian

""This brief, entertaining history of the kiss spans a number of eras, several genres, and a range of disciplines . . . Summing Up: Recommended. General readers."" - CHOICE

""The History of the Kiss! is exceptional. Marcel Danesi has provided an exceptional analysis and elucidation of all of the kiss's meanings in the various cultural contexts in which it exists. This is the best account of a fascinating and important social gesture that I have ever read."" - Frank Nuessel, University of Louisville, USA

""Danesi does it again: an entertaining and informative semiotic analysis showing that a mere trifle of popular culture is central to people's culture-specific understanding of who they are. Taking in origins, rituals, fiction, pictures, songs, movies, and the internet age, this book shows that the kiss is much more than an enquiry on the first floor as to whether the ground floor is available. It will be essential reading for media and cultural studies students and beyond."" - Paul Cobley, Professor in Language and Media, Middlesex University, UK

""Marcel Danesi's delightful book explores the science, art, history, and popular culture of humanity's most intimate exchange. Engaging and informative, The History of The Kiss! The Birth of Popular Culture will be treasured by readers for years to come."" - Sheril Kirshenbaum, author of The Science of Kissing

"Rutherford, Paul","Paul Rutherford","Is there any public discourse left, or has advertising, with its aggressive sales techniques, usurped the role of democratic, civil debate? Beginning in the 1960s, there was a proliferation of social, political, and corporate advertising in affluent, developed nations that spoke to the ""public good"" on everything from milk to family values. Surveying over 10,000 advertisements from the past 40 years, ""Endless Propaganda"" underscores the presence of advertising rhetoric, even in the context of apparently non-partisan collective health issues such as cancer.

The public sphere, argues Paul Rutherford, has been transformed into a huge marketplace of goods and signs. Civil advocacy has become a special art of authority that subjects politics, social behaviour, and public morals to the philosophy and discipline of marketing. Without suggesting that there is one simple way to understand the transformation that democracy has undergone because of this phenomenon, the author introduces and applies the cultural theories of several important philosophers: Habermas, Gramsci, Foucault, Ricoeur, and Baudrillard. The reader is thus given the necessary tools to critically examine the examples at hand and many others that exist beyond the pages of this study.

"Bilton, Nick","Nick Bilton","**NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER. The unbelievable true story of the man who built a billion-dollar online drug empire from his bedroom—and almost got away with it **  
  
In 2011, a twenty-six-year-old libertarian programmer named Ross Ulbricht launched the ultimate free market: the Silk Road, a clandestine Web site hosted on the Dark Web where anyone could trade anything—drugs, hacking software, forged passports, counterfeit cash, poisons—free of the government’s watchful eye.   
  
It wasn’t long before the media got wind of the new Web site where anyone—not just teenagers and weed dealers but terrorists and black hat hackers—could buy and sell contraband detection-free. Spurred by a public outcry, the federal government launched an epic two-year manhunt for the site’s elusive proprietor, with no leads, no witnesses, and no clear jurisdiction. All the investigators knew was that whoever was running the site called himself the Dread Pirate Roberts.   
  
The Silk Road quickly ballooned into $1.2 billion enterprise, and Ross embraced his new role as kingpin. He enlisted a loyal crew of allies in high and low places, all as addicted to the danger and thrill of running an illegal marketplace as their customers were to the heroin they sold. Through his network he got wind of the target on his back and took drastic steps to protect himself—including ordering a hit on a former employee. As Ross made plans to disappear forever, the Feds raced against the clock to catch a man they weren’t sure even existed, searching for a needle in the haystack of the global Internet. 

Drawing on exclusive access to key players and two billion digital words and images Ross left behind, *Vanity Fair* correspondent and *New York Times* bestselling author Nick Bilton offers a tale filled with twists and turns, lucky breaks and unbelievable close calls. It’s a story of the boy next door’s ambition gone criminal, spurred on by the clash between the new world of libertarian-leaning, anonymous, decentralized Web advocates and the old world of government control, order, and the rule of law. Filled with unforgettable characters and capped by an astonishing climax, *American Kingpin* might be dismissed as too outrageous for fiction. But it’s all too real.

"O'Neil, Cathy","Cathy O'Neil","**Longlisted for the National Book Award *| New York Times *Bestseller 

A former Wall Street quant sounds an alarm on the mathematical models that pervade modern life and threaten to rip apart our social fabric.** 

We live in the age of the algorithm. Increasingly, the decisions that affect our lives—where we go to school, whether we get a car loan, how much we pay for health insurance—are being made not by humans, but by mathematical models. In theory, this should lead to greater fairness: Everyone is judged according to the same rules, and bias is eliminated. 

But as Cathy O’Neil reveals in this urgent and necessary book, the opposite is true. The models being used today are opaque, unregulated, and uncontestable, even when they’re wrong. Most troubling, they reinforce discrimination: If a poor student can’t get a loan because a lending model deems him too risky (by virtue of his zip code), he’s then cut off from the kind of education that could pull him out of poverty, and a vicious spiral ensues. Models are propping up the lucky and punishing the downtrodden, creating a “toxic cocktail for democracy.” Welcome to the dark side of Big Data. 

Tracing the arc of a person’s life, O’Neil exposes the black box models that shape our future, both as individuals and as a society. These “weapons of math destruction” score teachers and students, sort résumés, grant (or deny) loans, evaluate workers, target voters, set parole, and monitor our health. 

O’Neil calls on modelers to take more responsibility for their algorithms and on policy makers to regulate their use. But in the end, it’s up to us to become more savvy about the models that govern our lives. This important book empowers us to ask the tough questions, uncover the truth, and demand change.

**""It's unlikely that Trump has ever read *Amusing Ourselves to Death*, but his ascent would not have surprised Postman.” -*CNN*

Originally published in 1985, Neil Postman’s groundbreaking polemic about the corrosive effects of television on our politics and public discourse has been hailed as a twenty-first-century book published in the twentieth century. Now, with television joined by more sophisticated electronic media—from the Internet to cell phones to DVDs—it has taken on even greater significance. *Amusing Ourselves to Death* is a prophetic look at what happens when politics, journalism, education, and even religion become subject to the demands of  entertainment. It is also a blueprint for regaining control of our media, so that they can serve our highest goals. 

“A brilliant, powerful, and important book. This is an indictment that Postman has laid down and, so far as I can see, an irrefutable one.” –Jonathan Yardley, *The Washington Post Book World*

Recently retired WWE superstar AJ Mendez Brooks is a powerhouse—strong, quirky, and totally confident. But that wasn’t always the case. With humor and tremendous heart, she opens up for the first time about her harrowing struggle to understand her demons and the diagnosis that helped her gain control over her life. **  
  
*Everything I was told should be my greatest insecurities and weaknesses, everything that I’ve been labeled—SHORT, NERDY, SKINNY, WEAK, IMPULSIVE, UGLY, TOMBOY, POOR, REBEL, LOUD, FREAK, CRAZY—turned out to be my greatest strengths. I didn’t become successful in spite of them. I became successful because of them.*  
** **  
Growing up AJ was a quiet girl trying to act “normal” when she felt anything but. As her family struggled with drug addiction, poverty, and mental illness, she found escape through comic books and video games, and was inspired by the tough and unconventional female characters. It wasn’t until she discovered pro wrestling** **that she learned superheroes could be real.  
  
Determined to become the superhero she’d always admired, AJ trained and sacrificed for years to achieve her dream of wrestling professionally. Yet she quickly faced industry pressure to play the role of the damsel in distress and to dress more provocatively to cater to male fans. But she fought back and created an ass-kicking alter ego that was a genuine representation of herself: nerdy, enthusiastic, and a little bit crazy.   
  
With humor and tremendous heart, AJ opens up for the first time about her harrowing struggle to understand her demons and the mental illness diagnosis that helped her gain control over her life. What most people view as a hardship, AJ embraced as inspira­tion for her superhero persona, shattering the stigma attached to mental illness.  
  
Charting her journey from a scrappy girl in an unstable home to an empowered wrestling champion, *Crazy Is My Superpower* is an un­flinchingly honest story and brave confessional about her long road to self-acceptance.

"Carse, James","James Carse","“There are at least two kinds of games,” states James Carse as he begins this extraordinary book. “One could be called finite; the other infinite.” 

Finite games are the familiar contests of everyday life; they are played in order to be won, which is when they end. But infinite games are more mysterious. Their object is not winning, but ensuring the continuation of play. The rules may change, the boundaries may change, even the participants may change—as long as the game is never allowed to come to an end. 

What are infinite games? How do they affect the ways we play our finite games? What are we doing when we play—finitely or infinitely? And how can infinite games affect the ways in which we live our lives? 

Carse explores these questions with stunning elegance, teasing out of his distinctions a universe of observation and insight, noting where and why and how we play, finitely and infinitely. He surveys our world—from the finite games of the playing field and playing board to the infinite games found in culture and religion—leaving all we think we know illuminated and transformed. Along the way, Carse finds new ways of understanding everything from how an actress portrays a role, to how we engage in sex, from the nature of evil, to the nature of science. Finite games, he shows, may offer wealth and status, power and glory. But infinite games offer something far more subtle and far grander. 

Carse has written a book rich in insight and aphorism. Already an international literary event, *Finite and Infinite Games* is certain to be argued about and celebrated for years to come. Reading it is the first step in learning to play the infinite game.

### From the Inside Flap

nary book that will dramatically change the way you experience life.  
Finite games are the familiar contests of everyday life, the games we play in business and politics, in the bedroom and on the battlefied -- games with winners and losers, a beginning and an end. Infinite games are more mysterious -- and ultimately more rewarding. They are unscripted and unpredictable; they are the source of true freedom.  
In this elegant and compelling work, James Carse explores what these games mean, and what they can mean to you. He offers stunning new insights into the nature of property and power, of culture and community, of sexuality and self-discovery, opening the door to a world of infinite delight and possibility.  
""An extraordinary little book . . . a wise and intimate companion, an elegant reminder of the real.""
